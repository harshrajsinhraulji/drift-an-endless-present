    "reasoning": "To support checkpoints and leaderboards in CyberNation, while adhering to Authorization Independence and QAPs, the Firestore structure is designed as follows:\n\n*   **Checkpoints:** Stored under `/users/{userId}/checkpoints/{checkpointId}`. This path-based ownership ensures that only the owning user can access their checkpoints. The `userId` is included within the checkpoint document itself (denormalized), enabling rules to validate ownership without needing to `get()` the parent user document.\n*   **Leaderboards:** Leaderboards are stored in the `/leaderboards/{leaderboardId}` collection. This allows for global management of leaderboards.\n*   **Leaderboard Entries:**  Each entry is stored in `/leaderboards/{leaderboardId}/entries/{entryId}`.  Each `LeaderboardEntry` includes the `userId`, enabling secure listing and filtering of entries by user.  Since listing leaderboard entries must be public, no denormalization is needed.  The structure facilitates queries for top scores within a specific leaderboard without requiring complex rules.\n\nThis design achieves Authorization Independence by denormalizing the `userId` into the `Checkpoint` and `LeaderboardEntry` documents, a key security practice that avoids the need for `get()` calls to parent documents in security rules. It supports QAPs by segregating user-owned data (checkpoints) from global data (leaderboards) and using path-based ownership for checkpoints."
