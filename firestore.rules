/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for CyberNation.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for checkpoints,
 * allows authenticated users to create their own leaderboard entries,
 * and allows public read access to leaderboards.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, acting as the root for user-owned data.
 * - /users/{userId}/checkpoints/{checkpointId}: Stores checkpoints for each user.
 * - /leaderboards/{leaderboardId}: Stores the definition of each leaderboard.
 * - /leaderboards/{leaderboardId}/entries/{entryId}: Stores leaderboard entries for each leaderboard.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own checkpoints and profiles.
 * - Authenticated users can create leaderboard entries for themselves.
 * - Leaderboards and leaderboard entries are publicly readable.
 * - Write access to leaderboards and updates/deletes to entries are restricted.
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` is denormalized into the `Checkpoint` and `LeaderboardEntry` documents. This allows for
 * authorization rules to validate ownership without needing to perform costly `get()` operations
 * on parent documents.
