/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for CyberNation.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for checkpoints,
 * while allowing public read access to leaderboards and leaderboard entries.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, acting as the root for user-owned data.
 * - /users/{userId}/checkpoints/{checkpointId}: Stores checkpoints for each user.
 * - /leaderboards/{leaderboardId}: Stores the definition of each leaderboard.
 * - /leaderboards/{leaderboardId}/entries/{entryId}: Stores leaderboard entries for each leaderboard.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own checkpoints.
 * - Leaderboards are publicly readable. Write access is implicitly denied (prototyping mode).
 * - Leaderboard entries are publicly readable. Write access is implicitly denied (prototyping mode).
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` is denormalized into the `Checkpoint` and `LeaderboardEntry` documents. This allows for
 * authorization rules to validate ownership without needing to perform costly `get()` operations
 * on parent documents. For example, a rule on `/users/{userId}/checkpoints/{checkpointId}` can
 * directly check `resource.data.userId == userId` instead of needing to fetch the user document.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * User-specific data (checkpoints) is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, while global data
 * (leaderboards) is stored in a top-level collection. This segregation simplifies access control
 * and improves query performance.
